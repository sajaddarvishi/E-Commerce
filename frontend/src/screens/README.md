# E-commerce Website with React, Django, and PostgreSQL
## Overview
This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built using a modern technology stack, including React, Django, and PostgreSQL. 

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Key Features
- User authentication and registration
- Product catalog with search and filtering options
- User profile and order history management

## Architecture
The website follows a client-server architecture, with React handling the client-side rendering and user interactions, Django managing the server-side logic and API endpoints, and PostgreSQL serving as the database for data storage.

## Installation and Setup
1. Install the required dependencies using `npm` or `yarn` for the frontend and `pip` for the backend.
2. Set up the PostgreSQL database by installing PostgreSQL and creating a new database.
3. Configure the Django project settings to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
4. Run database migrations using Django's migration commands.

## Development Workflow
1. Run the Django development server using the `runserver` command.
2. Run the React development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
3. Develop the frontend and backend components simultaneously, testing their integration as you go.
4. Commit your changes using Git and push them to a remote repository, such as GitHub.


## Future Enhancements
- Enhance search functionality by integrating with third-party search services like Elasticsearch or Algolia.
- Add support for multiple languages and currencies for international users.
